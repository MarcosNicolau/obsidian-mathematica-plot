## How to use

To use this plugin, **you must have installed wolframscript**. You can do it [here](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/workflow/InstallWolframScript.html).

Enter the command **Plot Graph** on the command palette to plot a graph. Then complete the fields, which accept Wolfram Mathematica code. I suggest checking their docs [here](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/FunctionVisualization.html).
