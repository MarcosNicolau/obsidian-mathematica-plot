Obsidian Mathematica Plot is a plugin that allows you to plot mathematical graphs using Wolfram Mathematica.

## Features

## How to use

In order to use this plugin, **you must have installed wolframscript**. You can do it [here](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/workflow/InstallWolframScript.html).

To plot a graph, enter the command **Plot Graph** on the command pallete. Then just complete the fields, which accept Wolfram Mathematica code. I suggest checking their docs [here](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/FunctionVisualization.html).
